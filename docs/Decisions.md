Decision:
Change reservation model from single-mode slot booking to dual-mode booking:

- `SELF_SERVICE`: existing time-slot reservation
- `SHOP_SERVICE`: package-based professional execution

`Helper mode` is deprecated and replaced by `SHOP_SERVICE`.

Reason:

- Service positioning should support both self-maintenance and professional use in one product.
- Shop-service package pricing should be visible per partner so market pricing is handled by partners.
- Package work still needs real schedule blocking to avoid operational conflict.

Key rules:

- Self Service keeps `1 hour minimum` and `30 minute` additional units.
- Shop Service uses package duration from the package catalog.
- Package duration is rounded up to `30-minute` blocks for schedule reservation.
- Example: `40 minutes` of package duration blocks `60 minutes`.
- If the shop decides the work cannot finish within the reserved time, a mechanic takes over and full labor charge still applies regardless of prior progress.

Options considered:

1. Keep current one-way self-service only model
- Simpler, but does not support professional execution in-product

2. Reuse helper mode as the second path
- Rejected because the new concept is not "helper assistance" but full shop/professional service

3. Introduce package-based shop-service reservation
- Selected
